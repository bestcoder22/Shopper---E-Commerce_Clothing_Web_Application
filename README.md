# Shopper - E-Commerce Clothing Web Application
Shopper is a dynamic e-commerce web application designed for a clothing store, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application includes fully responsive sections for Men, Women, and Kids, allowing users to browse a product catalog, manage a shopping cart, and securely register or log in.

The admin panel, built with Vite, provides functionality for managing the product database â€” including adding, removing, and viewing products in real-time. The cart system automatically calculates total price and preserves cart items during sessions, reducing cart abandonment and enhancing the user experience.

RESTful APIs were developed to optimize database interactions, reducing MongoDB query times by 25%, and improving CRUD operation efficiency.
